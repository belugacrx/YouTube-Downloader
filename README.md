## ⚠️ Important: Update `yt-dlp.exe` if the script doesn't work

**If the script fails to run, you may need to update `yt-dlp.exe`.**  
👉 Download the **latest version** from the [official yt-dlp releases page](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases).  
🔁 After downloading, **replace the existing `yt-dlp.exe` in your folder** — but **keep the file name exactly the same**.
